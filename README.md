## My process

### Built with

- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was similar to the summary card I first submitted but with a little bit more CSS involved. I learned how to utilize CSS media breakpoints to set specific styles for larger screens and also how to apply an overlay on top of the header image with ``` background-color and mix-blend-mode ``` instead of using my usual ``` position: absolute, background-color, and z-index ```
